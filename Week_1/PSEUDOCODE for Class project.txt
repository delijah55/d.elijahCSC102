SIMPLE INTEREST:
1. Take input for principal amount (P), rate of interest (R), and time duration (T) in years.
2. Calculate simple interest using the formula: (P * R * T) / 100
3. Print the calculated simple interest.

COMPOUND INTEREST:
1. Take input for principal amount (P), rate of interest (R), time duration (T), and number of times the interest is compounded per year (n).
2. Calculate the interest rate per period using the formula: r = R / n
3. Calculate the total number of periods using the formula: periods = n * T
4. Calculate the future value using the formula: FV = P * (1 + r)**periods
5. Print the calculated future value.

ANNUITY PLAN:
1. Take input for the periodic payment (PMT), rate of interest (R), time duration (T), and number of times the interest is compounded per year (n).
2. Calculate the interest rate per period using the formula: r = R / n
3. Calculate the future value using the formula: FV = PMT * ((1 + r)**(n * T) - 1) / (r * (1 + r)**(n * T))
4. Print the calculated future value.
